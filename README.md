# Recruitment-Resources

Hell everyone, Im [Robbie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbiecraigsimpson/)

Currently im working for HelloFresh in their Data team, mainly recruiting for our Berlin office. But I have experience recruiting across Europe within various tech companies. 

I decided to formalise this list after my bookmarks were getting a bit out of hand. Inspired by the [amazing awesome-recruitment](https://github.com/Sjamilla/awesome-recruitment) github. Over there Sjamilla has a far more indepth set of resources and youll notice a lot of mine are the same. Because Sjamilla's list is soo good im going to be a bit selfish so you might notice resource links being deleted/changed over time, as this list is mainly focussed at helping me, but if it helps you then thats great also!
