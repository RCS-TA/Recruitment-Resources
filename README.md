#  Recruitment Resources üî•

Hello everyone, Im [Robbie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbiecraigsimpson/)

Currently i'm working for HelloFresh in their Data team, mainly recruiting for our Berlin office. 

I decided to formalise this list after my bookmarks were getting a bit out of hand. Inspired by [awesome-recruitment](https://github.com/Sjamilla/awesome-recruitment) github. I have created a list of resources in which I use frequently or want to remember for future reference. Although the list is primarily for me, I decided to make it public as it might be useful for others, if you have any feedback etc please feel free to find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbiecraigsimpson/)

If you are looking for something more extensive the [awesome-recruitment](https://github.com/Sjamilla/awesome-recruitment) by Sjamilla  has a far more indepth set of resources, some of mine i've found through that list. 

Because the purpose of the list is more to self-organise you might notice resource links being deleted/changed over time so please bookmark/make your own list if you find something useful!
